Movie Correlation Data Project

This project aims to analyze and explore correlations between various movie factors such as box office revenue, ratings, genres, and more. Using a dataset of popular movies, the analysis dives into trends, statistical relationships, and insights that can help better understand what drives movie success. The project leverages tools such as Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, visualization, and insights extraction.

Key Features:
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and formatted data to ensure consistency.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigated key features such as movie genre, runtime, production budget, and audience ratings.
Correlation Matrix: Built a correlation matrix to analyze relationships between various numerical factors such as revenue, budget, and critic scores.
Visualizations: Created insightful visualizations, including scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps, to present trends and patterns.
Insights: Generated actionable insights on what factors most significantly affect box office success.
Technologies Used:
Languages: Python
Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib,Seaborn
Tools: Jupyter Notebook
This project was an exercise in understanding the various factors that contribute to a movieâ€™s success and building skills in data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
